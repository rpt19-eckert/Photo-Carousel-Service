## Overview
The Photo Carousel Module is a inherited service with legacy deo. I worked on back-end system design of the service.
This Photo Carousel's back-end was designed and written together with two other services to create an Item Listing Page within a team of 3 people.

### My contributions:
* Achieved improvement on performance from 200 rps to 2000 rps.
* Horizontal and Vertical Scaling Photo Carousel Service Module.
* Coordinated and deployed entire teamâ€™s modules on proxy server EC2 instance.
* Utilized agile workflow practices on a 3 - person remote team.
